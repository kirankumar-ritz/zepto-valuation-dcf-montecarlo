# 💰 Zepto Valuation using Advanced DCF & Monte Carlo Simulation

## 🧭 Overview
This project presents a **comprehensive financial valuation of Zepto**, one of India’s fastest-growing **Quick Commerce** startups.  
It combines the **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)** method with **Monte Carlo Simulation** to estimate Zepto’s intrinsic value while capturing uncertainty and risk.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Estimate Zepto’s enterprise value using deterministic and probabilistic models.
- Apply **1,000-run Monte Carlo Simulation** to analyze valuation under uncertainty.
- Assess sensitivity to key drivers — **FCFF, WACC, and terminal growth rate**.
- Derive strategic insights for investors and startup valuation professionals.

## 🧮 Tools & Technologies
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **Microsoft Excel** | DCF base model & FCFF calculations |
| **R Programming** | Monte Carlo simulation & data visualization |
| **ggplot2 / dplyr** | Statistical charts & sensitivity heatmaps |

---

## 📈 Key Results
| Method | Valuation Output |
|--------|------------------|
| DCF Valuation | ₹17,408 Cr |
| Monte Carlo Range | ₹8,300 Cr – ₹51,400 Cr |
| Median (Simulation) | ₹18,559 Cr |
| Probability (Valuation > ₹14,000 Cr) | 75% |

**Conclusion:** Zepto is likely **undervalued**, with strong upside potential based on modeled financial scenarios.
